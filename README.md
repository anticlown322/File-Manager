## :mag: Details

PHP version: _8.3_

Only PHP + HTML + CSS, no frameworks.

I tried to implement a MVC pattern, but failed :unamused:. So project structure might be a bit confusing.
Also I created a simple template engine so as not to mix PHP and HTML code, but it made more complicated.

If you have a desire to create something similar to the pictures below, it's better to follow the guides above.
